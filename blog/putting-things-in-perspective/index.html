The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p></blockquote></div></article><footer><hr><p class=posted>Posted January 1, 2014 by <a href=https://twitter.com/schjonhaug>@schjonhaug</a></p></footer></main></div><script src=/js/scripts.d41d.js></script></body></html>
