You can read emails, order a new TV, or hijack cloud-storage accounts until you’ve accessed or deleted every trace of a person’s digital life. You can do it from anywhere with an internet connection — effectively anywhere in the world — and it’s easy to hide where you’re doing it from.</p></blockquote><p>The horros of passwords in the wrong hands were painfully felt by <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/11/ff-mat-honan-password-hacker/all/">Wired&#39;s Mat Honan back in 2012</a>:</p><blockquote><p>This summer, hackers destroyed my entire digital life in the span of an hour. My Apple, Twitter, and Gmail passwords were all robust—seven, 10, and 19 characters, respectively, all alphanumeric, some with symbols thrown in as well—but the three accounts were linked, so once the hackers had conned their way into one, they had them all. They really just wanted my Twitter handle: @mat. As a three-letter username, it’s considered prestigious. And to delay me from getting it back, they used my Apple account to wipe every one of my devices, my iPhone and iPad and MacBook, deleting all my messages and documents and every picture I’d ever taken of my 18-month-old daughter.</p></blockquote><p>The problems with passwords are many and obvious, and though two-factor authentication is a step in the right direction, the FIDO alliance are trying to take it a step further. The idea is you log in to your computer or phone using a wide range of authentication technologies, such as:</p><ul><li>fingerprint scanners</li><li>iris scanners</li><li>voice recognition</li><li>facial recognition</li><li>Trusted Platform Modules (TPM)</li><li>USB Security Tokens</li><li>embedded Secure Elements (eSE)</li><li>Smart Cards</li><li>Near Field Communication (NFC)</li></ul><p>Then, using a technique called <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_knowledge_proof>zero-knowledge proof</a>, other sites can in turn let you log in, because you&#39;re already authenticated.</p><p>The newly launched Samsung Galaxy S5 is one of the first phones using this technology, letting you use it to authenticate with PayPal. However, it didn&#39;t take long before it&#39;s fingerprint scanner got <a href="http://bgr.com/2014/04/15/galaxy-s5s-fingerprint-scanner-hacked/">hacked</a>.</p><p>The weakest link is then obviously the quality of the authentication technology used on the devices. And since a compromised device would allow access to all services through zero-knowdlegde proof, wouldn&#39;t this be as bad as using the same password on all sites?</p></div></article><footer><hr><div class=posted>Posted April 16, 2014 by <a href=https://twitter.com/schjonhaug>@schjonhaug</a></div><div class=sharing><span>Share on</span><ul class=soc><li><a class="soc-twitter soc-icon-last" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Password killers and the weakest link by @schjonhaug&url=http://schjonhaug.github.io/blog/password-killers-and-the-weakest-link"></a></li><!--<li><a class="soc-facebook" href="#"></a></li>
