My first SLR was a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D70>Nikon D70</a> back in 2005. A few years later I upgraded to a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D90>D90</a>, but soon found it (as I had with the D70) too big to carry around. I eventually sold all my Nikon gear, and opted in 2010 for a <a href=http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/PanasonicGF1>Panasonic Lumix GF1</a>, an excellent micro-four-thirds system camera with a fixed 20mm lens. I enjoyed the compact size, and this camera accomanied me on my trip around the world in 2011. However, I also brought an iPhone 4, which I used just as much. Last year, I bought what I believe to be my last non networked camera, the brilliant full format camera <a href=http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sony-cybershot-dsc-rx1>Sony RX1</a>. The quality of the images were absolutely stunning, but as with the GF1, I didn&#39;t bring it with me enough to justify the purchase.</p><p>Today, I have sold all of my photo equipment and only shoot with the iPhone 5S. The ability to instantly edit and share my photos from whereever I am wins hands down over the old process of shooting, bringing the camera back to the computer, unload the files, edit and upload. Phones still have a way to go in terms of pure photo quality, but add on lenses like <a href="http://photojojo.com/store/awesomeness/cell-phone-lenses/">Photojojo</a>, <a href="http://www.olloclip.com/">Olloclip</a> and <a href="http://momentlens.co/">Moment</a> are trying to bridge the gap. Moreover, Adobe are in the works of making <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/01/17/lightroom-for-ipad-briefly-appears-on-adobes-website-coming-soon-with-99year-cloud-subscription/">Lightroom for iPad</a>, which shows just how important mobile cameras have become.</p></div></article><footer><hr><p class=posted>Posted January 17, 2014 by <a href=https://twitter.com/schjonhaug>@schjonhaug</a></p></footer></main></div><script src=/js/scripts.d41d.js></script></body></html>
