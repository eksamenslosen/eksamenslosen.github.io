You can read emails, order a new TV, or hijack cloud-storage accounts until you’ve accessed or deleted every trace of a person’s digital life. You can do it from anywhere with an internet connection — effectively anywhere in the world — and it’s easy to hide where you’re doing it from.</p></blockquote><p>The horros of passwords in the wrong hands were painfully felt by <a href="http://www.wired.com/2012/11/ff-mat-honan-password-hacker/all/">Wired&#39;s Mat Honan back in 2012</a>:</p><blockquote><p>This summer, hackers destroyed my entire digital life in the span of an hour. My Apple, Twitter, and Gmail passwords were all robust—seven, 10, and 19 characters, respectively, all alphanumeric, some with symbols thrown in as well—but the three accounts were linked, so once the hackers had conned their way into one, they had them all. They really just wanted my Twitter handle: @mat. As a three-letter username, it’s considered prestigious. And to delay me from getting it back, they used my Apple account to wipe every one of my devices, my iPhone and iPad and MacBook, deleting all my messages and documents and every picture I’d ever taken of my 18-month-old daughter.</p></blockquote><p>The problems with passwords are many and obvious, and though two-factor authentication is a step in the right direction, the FIDO alliance are trying to take it a step further. The idea is you log in to your computer or phone using a wide range of authentication technologies, such as:</p><ul><li>fingerprint scanners</li><li>iris scanners</li><li>voice recognition</li><li>facial recognition</li><li>Trusted Platform Modules (TPM)</li><li>USB Security Tokens</li><li>embedded Secure Elements (eSE)</li><li>Smart Cards</li><li>Near Field Communication (NFC)</li></ul><p>Then, using a technique called <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_knowledge_proof>zero-knowledge proof</a>, other sites can in turn let you log in, because you&#39;re already authenticated.</p><p>The newly launched Samsung Galaxy S5 is one of the first phones using this technology, letting you use it to authenticate with PayPal. However, it didn&#39;t take long before it&#39;s fingerprint scanner got <a href="http://bgr.com/2014/04/15/galaxy-s5s-fingerprint-scanner-hacked/">hacked</a>.</p><p>The weakest link is then obviously the quality of the authentication technology used on the devices. And since a compromised device would allow access to all services through zero-knowdlegde proof, wouldn&#39;t this be as bad as using the same password on all sites?</p></div></article><!--<li><span>16 Apr 2014</span> &raquo; <a href="/blog/formula-1-pit-stops-in-1950-and-today">Formula 1 pit stops in 1950 and today</a></li>--><article><header><h1><!--<time class="post-date">16 Apr 2014</time>--><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRy_73ivcms">Formula 1 pit stops in 1950 and today</a> <span class=permalink><a href=/blog/formula-1-pit-stops-in-1950-and-today>∞</a></span></h1></header><div class=post><div class=video-container><iframe width=420 height=315 src=//www.youtube.com/embed/RRy_73ivcms frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Progress.</p></div></article><!--<li><span>14 Apr 2014</span> &raquo; <a href="/blog/should-and-must">Should and must</a></li>--><article><header><h1><!--<time class="post-date">14 Apr 2014</time>--><a href=https://medium.com/medium-long/90c75eb7c5b0>Should and must</a> <span class=permalink><a href=/blog/should-and-must>∞</a></span></h1></header><div class=post><p>Elle Luna:</p><blockquote><p>There are two paths in life: Should and Must.

My first SLR was a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D70>Nikon D70</a> back in 2005. A few years later I upgraded to a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D90>D90</a>, but soon found it (as I had with the D70) too big to carry around. I eventually sold all my Nikon gear, and opted in 2010 for a <a href=http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/PanasonicGF1>Panasonic Lumix GF1</a>, an excellent micro-four-thirds system camera with a fixed 20mm lens. I enjoyed the compact size, and this camera accomanied me on my trip around the world in 2011. However, I also brought an iPhone 4, which I used just as much. Last year, I bought what I believe to be my last non networked camera, the brilliant full format camera <a href=http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sony-cybershot-dsc-rx1>Sony RX1</a>. The quality of the images were absolutely stunning, but as with the GF1, I didn&#39;t bring it with me enough to justify the purchase.</p><p>Today, I have sold all of my photo equipment and only shoot with the iPhone 5S. The ability to instantly edit and share my photos from whereever I am wins hands down over the old process of shooting, bringing the camera back to the computer, unload the files, edit and upload. Phones still have a way to go in terms of pure photo quality, but add on lenses like <a href="http://photojojo.com/store/awesomeness/cell-phone-lenses/">Photojojo</a>, <a href="http://www.olloclip.com/">Olloclip</a> and <a href="http://momentlens.co/">Moment</a> are trying to bridge the gap. Moreover, Adobe are in the works of making <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/01/17/lightroom-for-ipad-briefly-appears-on-adobes-website-coming-soon-with-99year-cloud-subscription/">Lightroom for iPad</a>, which shows just how important mobile cameras have become.</p></div></article><!--<li><span>12 Jan 2014</span> &raquo; <a href="/blog/the-importance-of-a-great-product">The Importance of a Great Product</a></li>--><article><header><h1><!--<time class="post-date">12 Jan 2014</time>--><a href=http://blog.samaltman.com/the-only-way-to-grow-huge>The Importance of a Great Product</a> <span class=permalink><a href=/blog/the-importance-of-a-great-product>∞</a></span></h1></header><div class=post><p>Sam Altman:</p><blockquote><p>(...) if you want to be a great company some day, you have to eventually build something so good that people will recommend it to their friends--in fact, so good that they want to be the first one to recommend it to their friends for the implied good taste. No growth hack, brilliant marketing idea, or sales team can save you long term if you don&#39;t have a sufficiently good product.</p></blockquote></div></article><!--<li><span>01 Jan 2014</span> &raquo; <a href="/blog/putting-things-in-perspective">Putting Things in Perspective</a></li>--><article><header><h1><!--<time class="post-date">01 Jan 2014</time>--><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=923jxZY2NPI">Putting Things in Perspective</a> <span class=permalink><a href=/blog/putting-things-in-perspective>∞</a></span></h1></header><div class=post><div class=video-container><iframe width=560 height=315 src=//www.youtube.com/embed/923jxZY2NPI frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>Carl Sagan:</p><blockquote><p>From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it&#39;s different. Consider again that dot. That&#39;s here. That&#39;s home. That&#39;s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p></blockquote></div></article></div></main></div><script src=/js/scripts.d41d.js></script></body></html>
