My first SLR was a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D70>Nikon D70</a> back in 2005. A few years later I upgraded to a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D90>D90</a>, but soon found it (as I had with the D70) too big to carry around. I eventually sold all my Nikon gear, and opted in 2010 for a <a href=http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/PanasonicGF1>Panasonic Lumix GF1</a>, an excellent micro-four-thirds system camera with a fixed 20mm lens. I enjoyed the compact size, and this camera accomanied me on my trip around the world in 2011. However, I also brought an iPhone 4, which I used just as much. Last year, I bought what I believe to be my last non networked camera, the brilliant full format camera <a href=http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/sony-cybershot-dsc-rx1>Sony RX1</a>. The quality of the images were absolutely stunning, but as with the GF1, I didn&#39;t bring it with me enough to justify the purchase.</p><p>Today, I have sold all of my photo equipment and only shoot with the iPhone 5S. The ability to instantly edit and share my photos from whereever I am wins hands down over the old process of shooting, bringing the camera back to the computer, unload the files, edit and upload. Phones still have a way to go in terms of pure photo quality, but add on lenses like <a href="http://photojojo.com/store/awesomeness/cell-phone-lenses/">Photojojo</a>, <a href="http://www.olloclip.com/">Olloclip</a> and <a href="http://momentlens.co/">Moment</a> are trying to bridge the gap. Moreover, Adobe are in the works of making <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2014/01/17/lightroom-for-ipad-briefly-appears-on-adobes-website-coming-soon-with-99year-cloud-subscription/">Lightroom for iPad</a>, which shows just how important mobile cameras have become.</p></div></article><!--<li><span>12 Jan 2014</span> &raquo; <a href="/blog/the-importance-of-a-great-product">The Importance of a Great Product</a></li>--><article><header><h1><!--<time class="post-date">12 Jan 2014</time>--><a href=http://blog.samaltman.com/the-only-way-to-grow-huge>The Importance of a Great Product</a> <span class=permalink><a href=/blog/the-importance-of-a-great-product>∞</a></span></h1></header><div class=post><p>Sam Altman:</p><blockquote><p>(...) if you want to be a great company some day, you have to eventually build something so good that people will recommend it to their friends--in fact, so good that they want to be the first one to recommend it to their friends for the implied good taste. No growth hack, brilliant marketing idea, or sales team can save you long term if you don&#39;t have a sufficiently good product.</p></blockquote></div></article><!--<li><span>01 Jan 2014</span> &raquo; <a href="/blog/putting-things-in-perspective">Putting Things in Perspective</a></li>--><article><header><h1><!--<time class="post-date">01 Jan 2014</time>--><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=923jxZY2NPI">Putting Things in Perspective</a> <span class=permalink><a href=/blog/putting-things-in-perspective>∞</a></span></h1></header><div class=post><!-- <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/923jxZY2NPI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> --><p>Carl Sagan:</p><blockquote><p>From this distant vantage point, the Earth might not seem of any particular interest. But for us, it&#39;s different. Consider again that dot. That&#39;s here. That&#39;s home. That&#39;s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every “superstar,” every “supreme leader,” every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p></blockquote></div></article></div></main></div><script src=/js/scripts.d41d.js></script></body></html>
